# Poker Dataset Generator: Range Generation Design

This document outlines the design and implementation of the `range_generator.py` module, which is responsible for generating poker hand ranges for game state analysis.

## Core Objectives:

1.  **Define Base Ranges:** Establish standard archetypes for player ranges (Tight, Balanced, Loose) for both In-Position (IP) and Out-of-Position (OOP) players.
2.  **Dynamic Range Adaptation:** For a designated "hero" player with a known hand, adaptively select the most appropriate base range type to ensure coherence between the hero\'s actual holding and the assigned range.
3.  **Range Perturbation:** Introduce controlled randomness to the base ranges to create a diverse set of slightly varied ranges, making the generated dataset richer.
4.  **Output Formats:** Provide ranges as both lists of hand strings and comma-separated strings suitable for poker solver inputs.

## Key Components & Logic in `range_generator.py`:

### 1. Constants and Basic Hand Utilities:

*   **`RANKS`**: List of card ranks (`['A', 'K', ..., '2']`).
*   **`HAND_TYPES`**: `['s', 'o']` (suited, offsuit).
*   **`ALL_169_HAND_COMBINATIONS`**: A list holding all 169 unique poker hand combinations (e.g., "AA", "AKs", "T9o").
    *   Initialized by `_initialize_169_hands()`.
*   **`SORTED_MASTER_HAND_LIST`**: `ALL_169_HAND_COMBINATIONS` sorted by a canonical strength order (AA, AKs, AKo, KK...). This is crucial for strength comparisons and neighbor identification.
*   **`HAND_STRENGTH_RANK`**: A dictionary mapping each hand string from `SORTED_MASTER_HAND_LIST` to its numerical strength rank (0 = strongest, 168 = weakest).
*   **`get_rank_index(rank_char)`**: Helper to get the numerical index of a rank character.

### 2. Shorthand Range Expansion:

*   **`expand_range_shorthand(shorthand_str)`**:
    *   Takes a poker shorthand string (e.g., "JJ+", "A9s+", "77-99", "AQ+") as input.
    *   Expands it into a list of specific, canonical hand combinations (e.g., "JJ+" -> `["JJ", "QQ", "KK", "AA"]`).
    *   Handles pairs, suited/offsuit kickers, plus notation, and dash notation for common cases.
    *   Uses `ALL_169_HAND_COMBINATIONS` for validation and `HAND_TYPES` for suit logic.

### 3. Reference Range Definitions:

*   **`REFERENCE_RANGES_SHORTHAND`**: A nested dictionary storing the defined base ranges using shorthand notation.
    *   Structure: `{'OOP': {'Tight': "shorthand", ...}, 'IP': {'Tight': "shorthand", ...}}`
    *   These define the archetypal Tight, Balanced, and Loose ranges for OOP and IP players.
*   **`PROCESSED_REFERENCE_RANGES`**: A nested dictionary populated by processing `REFERENCE_RANGES_SHORTHAND`.
    *   Structure mirrors `REFERENCE_RANGES_SHORTHAND` but replaces shorthand strings with sorted lists of actual hand combinations (expanded by `expand_range_shorthand`).
    *   Populated by `_process_reference_ranges()` at module load.
*   **`_process_reference_ranges()`**: Iterates through `REFERENCE_RANGES_SHORTHAND`, calls `expand_range_shorthand` for each part of the comma-separated shorthand, and stores the resulting lists in `PROCESSED_REFERENCE_RANGES`.

### 4. Range Strength and Boundary Analysis:

*   **`get_range_strength_bounds(range_list)`**:
    *   Input: A list of hand strings.
    *   Output: A tuple `(min_strength_rank, max_strength_rank)` representing the strongest and weakest hands in the list, based on `HAND_STRENGTH_RANK`.

### 5. Adaptive Range Selection for Hero:

*   **Constants for Adaptive Logic:**
    *   `PLAYER_ROLES = ['OOP', 'IP']`
    *   `RANGE_TYPE_ORDER = ['Tight', 'Balanced', 'Loose']` (Defines adjustment path)
    *   `DEFAULT_INITIAL_RANGE_TYPE = 'Balanced'`
    *   `ACCEPTABLE_WEAKNESS_OFFSET`, `ACCEPTABLE_STRENGTH_OFFSET`: Thresholds for determining if a hero's hand is too far from a range category's bounds.
*   **`determine_hero_range_type_and_base_range(...)`**:
    *   Inputs: `hero_hand_str`, `hero_player_role`, `initial_range_type_preference`, offsets.
    *   Compares the `hero_hand_str`'s strength rank against the bounds of the `PROCESSED_REFERENCE_RANGES` for the `initial_range_type_preference`.
    *   If the hero's hand is too weak for the current type (based on `weakness_offset`), it attempts to shift to a looser type in `RANGE_TYPE_ORDER`.
    *   If too strong (based on `strength_offset`), it attempts to shift to a tighter type.
    *   Returns the `final_hero_range_type` and the corresponding `final_base_hero_range_list`.

### 6. Range Perturbation:

*   **`PERTURBATION_PARAMS`**: A dictionary holding parameters for the perturbation process:
    *   `prob_keep_core_hand`: Probability a hand from the base range is kept.
    *   `prob_add_stronger_neighbor`, `prob_add_weaker_neighbor`: Probabilities for adding neighboring hands.
    *   `neighbor_window_half_size`: Defines how many hands (by strength rank) around a core hand are considered neighbors.
    *   `max_added_hands_percentage`, `max_removed_hands_percentage`: Caps on how much the range can change relative to its original size.
*   **`_perform_perturbation(base_range_list, player_role, range_type)`**:
    *   Takes a `base_range_list` (e.g., selected by adaptive logic for hero, or directly for villain).
    *   **Keep/Remove Core Hands:** Iterates through `base_range_list`. Each hand is kept or (conditionally, respecting `max_removed_hands_percentage`) removed based on `prob_keep_core_hand`.
    *   **Identify & Add Neighbors:**
        *   For each hand originally in the base range, it identifies "neighboring" hands from `SORTED_MASTER_HAND_LIST` within the `neighbor_window_half_size`.
        *   Neighbors not in the original base range become candidates for addition.
        *   Candidates are shuffled and probabilistically added (respecting `max_added_hands_percentage`) based on an average of `prob_add_stronger_neighbor` and `prob_add_weaker_neighbor`.
    *   Returns a sorted list of perturbed hand strings.

### 7. Main Range Generation Function:

*   **`generate_player_range_info(...)`**:
    *   Primary interface for generating range data for a player.
    *   Inputs: `player_role`, `is_hero` (boolean), `hero_hand_str_if_any`, `range_type_preference`.
    *   **Hero Logic:** If `is_hero`, it calls `determine_hero_range_type_and_base_range` to get an adaptively chosen base range.
    *   **Villain Logic:** If not `is_hero`, it uses `range_type_preference` directly to select a base range from `PROCESSED_REFERENCE_RANGES`.
    *   Calls `_perform_perturbation` on the selected base range.
    *   **Hero Hand Force Inclusion:** If `is_hero`, it ensures `hero_hand_str_if_any` is present in the final perturbed list (safety net).
    *   Converts the final list to a comma-separated string.
    *   Returns a dictionary containing: `player_role`, `is_hero`, `hero_hand_actual`, `range_type_selected`, counts, sample hands, and `final_range_str`.

### 8. Gamestate Augmentation Utilities (within `range_generator.py`):

These functions bridge the core range generation logic with the processing of entire gamestates.

*   **`holding_to_hand_str(card1_repr, card2_repr)`**:
    *   Converts various representations of a hero's two hole cards (e.g., string "As", tuple ('K','c'), card objects) into the canonical 169-hand string format (e.g., "AKs", "TT", "72o").
    *   This standardized string is crucial for looking up hand strength and ensuring compatibility with range definitions.

*   **`augment_gamestate_with_ranges(gamestate_data, hero_is_oop_field='hero_is_oop', hero_holding_field='hero_holding')`**:
    *   Takes a single gamestate dictionary as input. This dictionary is expected to contain information about the hero's holding (parsable by `holding_to_hand_str`) and whether the hero is out of position.
    *   Determines the hero's role (OOP/IP) and parses their actual hand into the 169-string format using `holding_to_hand_str`.
    *   Randomly selects initial range type preferences (Tight, Balanced, Loose) for both the OOP and IP players.
    *   Calls `generate_player_range_info` for the OOP player, passing whether they are the hero, their actual hand string (if hero), and the randomly chosen preference.
    *   Calls `generate_player_range_info` for the IP player similarly.
    *   Adds the following keys to a copy of the input `gamestate_data` dictionary and returns it:
        *   `oop_range_str`: Comma-separated string of the OOP player's final perturbed range.
        *   `oop_range_type_selected`: The range type (e.g., 'Tight', 'Balanced_Adapted') chosen for the OOP player.
        *   `ip_range_str`: Comma-separated string of the IP player's final perturbed range.
        *   `ip_range_type_selected`: The range type chosen for the IP player.
        *   Initially, it also added `hero_hand_parsed_str`, but this was removed as it was deemed redundant with the original `holding` column in the CSV.

*   **`process_gamestate_dataset(list_of_gamestate_dicts, ...)`**:
    *   A wrapper function that takes a list of gamestate dictionaries.
    *   Iterates through the list, calling `augment_gamestate_with_ranges` for each dictionary.
    *   Collects the augmented dictionaries and returns them as a new list. Includes basic error handling to skip problematic gamestates.


## CSV Processing and Dataset Creation (`create_range_augmented_dataset.py`):

This script serves as the main entry point for generating the augmented dataset by reading an input CSV, processing each row to generate ranges, and writing to an output CSV.

### 1. Core Functions:

*   **`parse_holding_from_str(holding_str)`**:
    *   A utility function to parse a 4-character holding string (e.g., "AhKd" from the CSV) into a list of two card strings (e.g., `["Ah", "Kd"]`). This format is suitable for input to `holding_to_hand_str` within `range_generator.py`.
    *   Raises a ValueError for invalid formats.

*   **`create_augmented_dataset(input_csv_path, output_csv_path, num_test_rows=0)` (formerly `process_input_csv`)**:
    *   Orchestrates the entire CSV processing workflow.
    *   **File Handling:** Opens the `input_csv_path` for reading and prepares `output_csv_path` for writing.
    *   **CSV Reading:** Uses `csv.DictReader` to read rows from the input file.
    *   **Fieldname Management:** Dynamically determines the fieldnames for the output CSV, starting with the original fieldnames and appending new ones for the generated range data (`oop_range_str`, `oop_range_type_selected`, `ip_range_str`, `ip_range_type_selected`).
    *   **Row Processing Loop:** For each row in the input CSV:
        *   Creates a mutable `gamestate_data` dictionary from the current row.
        *   **Hero Position:** Parses the `hero_position` column (e.g., "OOP" or "IP") to determine if the hero is out of position (`hero_is_oop` boolean). Skips row if invalid.
        *   **Hero Holding:** Parses the `holding` column string (e.g., "AsKc") using `parse_holding_from_str` to get a list like `["As", "Kc"]`. Skips row if invalid.
        *   **Augmentation Call:** Calls `augment_gamestate_with_ranges` (from `range_generator.py`) with the `gamestate_data` dictionary, the hero's position, and their parsed holding. The field names used by `augment_gamestate_with_ranges` for holding and position are explicitly passed.
        *   The `augment_gamestate_with_ranges` function returns the `gamestate_data` dictionary now augmented with the new range string columns and selected range type columns.
        *   Handles errors during parsing or augmentation for a row, printing a warning and skipping the problematic row.
    *   **CSV Writing:** After processing all rows (or `num_test_rows`), uses `csv.DictWriter` to write the list of augmented dictionaries to the `output_csv_path`.
    *   Includes progress messages and error reporting.

### 2. Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

*   Provides a test/sample execution capability.
*   Defines paths for a dummy input CSV and a test output CSV.
*   Includes logic to create a small, sample `dummy_input_for_test.csv` file with a few rows of data mimicking the structure of the user's actual dataset.
*   Calls `create_augmented_dataset` to process this dummy file (or a specified number of rows from the actual dataset for a quick test) and save the output.
*   Contains commented-out lines for running the script on the full dataset.


## Overall Dataset Generation Pipeline:

1.  **Input:** A CSV file (`datasets/postflop_500k_train_set_game_scenario_information.csv`) where each row represents a game scenario, including at least `holding` (e.g., "AhKd") and `hero_position` ("OOP" or "IP") columns.
2.  **Execution:** The user runs `python -m dataset_generator.create_augmented_dataset`.
3.  **CSV Parsing (`create_range_augmented_dataset.py`):**
    *   The script reads the input CSV row by row.
    *   For each row, it extracts `holding` and `hero_position`.
    *   `holding` string (e.g., "AhKd") is parsed into a list of two card strings (e.g., `["Ah", "Kd"]`) by `parse_holding_from_str`.
4.  **Gamestate Augmentation (`range_generator.py` via `create_range_augmented_dataset.py`):**
    *   `create_range_augmented_dataset.py` calls `augment_gamestate_with_ranges` from `range_generator.py` for each row's data.
    *   Inside `augment_gamestate_with_ranges`:
        *   The hero's card list is converted to a 169-hand string (e.g., "AKo") by `holding_to_hand_str`.
        *   Initial range types (Tight, Balanced, Loose) are randomly selected for OOP and IP players.
        *   `generate_player_range_info` is called for both OOP and IP roles:
            *   **Hero's Range:** The hero's actual hand string and initial range type preference guide the adaptive selection (`determine_hero_range_type_and_base_range`) to pick a suitable base range (e.g., "Balanced OOP"). This base range is then perturbed (`_perform_perturbation`), and the hero's actual hand is force-included.
            *   **Villain's Range:** The villain's initial range type preference directly selects their base range, which is then perturbed.
        *   The function returns the original gamestate data augmented with `oop_range_str`, `ip_range_str`, `oop_range_type_selected`, and `ip_range_type_selected`.
5.  **Output CSV Generation (`create_range_augmented_dataset.py`):**
    *   The script collects all augmented rows.
    *   A new CSV file (e.g., `dataset_generator/augmented_gamestates.csv`) is written, containing all original columns plus the newly generated range information.

## Workflow for Generating a Gamestate's Ranges (Summary from `range_generator.py` perspective):

1.  **Parse Hero Hand:** Given hero's raw holding (e.g. from CSV as `["Ah", "Kd"]`), `holding_to_hand_str` converts it to a canonical string (e.g., "AKo").
2.  **Determine Roles:** Identify which player is OOP and IP, and which one is the hero.
3.  **Initial Preferences:** Randomly assign an initial range type (Tight, Balanced, Loose) for OOP and IP.
4.  **Generate OOP Range:**
    *   Call `generate_player_range_info` for OOP.
    *   If OOP is hero: `determine_hero_range_type_and_base_range` adapts the initial preference based on hero's "AKo".
    *   The chosen base range is perturbed by `_perform_perturbation`.
    *   "AKo" is ensured to be in the final list.
    *   Result: `oop_range_str` and `oop_range_type_selected`.
5.  **Generate IP Range:**
    *   Call `generate_player_range_info` for IP.
    *   If IP is hero (not in this example): similar adaptive logic.
    *   If IP is villain: initial preference selects base range directly.
    *   The chosen base range is perturbed.
    *   Result: `ip_range_str` and `ip_range_type_selected`.
6.  **Combine:** The original gamestate data is updated with these four new pieces of information.

## Solver Output Generation for Internal Search Traces

The `internal_search_poker_internal_search_methodology.txt` paper details the structure of linearized search traces required for training the poker LLM. A crucial component of this is obtaining detailed game-theoretic evaluations from a sophisticated poker solver. The `dataset_generator/query_solver.py` module will serve as the primary Python interface for this task.

### Role and Adaptation of `query_solver.py`

While `range_generator.py` focuses on defining player hand ranges for various game scenarios, `query_solver.py` will be responsible for taking these scenarios (defined by ranges, board cards, pot, stack, and history) and retrieving the rich strategic information output by the underlying Rust poker solver.

**1. Required Data Points:**
As outlined in Section 5.1 ("Data Generation") of the methodology paper, `query_solver.py` (through the Rust solver) needs to provide data for each decision point Hero faces. This includes:
*   **Hero Action EVs:** For a set of canonical actions available to Hero (e.g., check, bet small, bet medium, fold), the solver-calculated Expected Value (EV) for Hero taking each specific action.
*   **Opponent Response Analysis:** Following a specific Hero action:
    *   The distribution of likely opponent responses (e.g., fold, call, raise specific sizes) according to their GTO strategy, including the probability of each response.
    *   The EV for Hero resulting from each of these opponent responses.
*   **Abstracted Card Outcome EVs:** For chance nodes (e.g., dealing the turn or river card), the EV for Hero after various abstracted card outcomes (e.g., "Flush-Completing Card," "Blank Card"). These abstracted outcome EVs are solver-calculated weighted averages over all actual cards falling into that strategic category.

**2. Necessary Modifications to `query_solver.py` and Rust FFI:**
The current `run_solver_from_rust` function in `query_solver.py` calls the Rust FFI function `run_solver_for_gamestate_ffi`, which has a `void` return type (`restype = None`). To retrieve the detailed data points listed above, significant modifications will be required:
*   **Rust FFI Enhancement:** The Rust function `run_solver_for_gamestate_ffi` (or a new dedicated FFI function) must be modified. Instead of returning `void`, it needs to compute and then return the detailed strategic information. This could be achieved by:
    *   Returning a C-style string (`ctypes.c_char_p`) containing serialized data (e.g., a JSON string) that encapsulates all the required EV and probability information.
    *   Populating a complex C-compatible struct passed by reference from Python, with fields for all the necessary data.
*   **Python-Side Handling in `query_solver.py`:**
    *   The `restype` for the FFI function in `query_solver.py` must be updated to match the new return type (e.g., `solver_lib.run_solver_for_gamestate_ffi.restype = ctypes.c_char_p`).
    *   If data is returned as a string (e.g., JSON), `query_solver.py` will need to decode/parse this string into a structured Python object (e.g., a dictionary or a custom data class).
    *   If a struct is used, Python will need to define the corresponding `ctypes.Structure` and read data from it after the FFI call.

**3. Workflow for Data Extraction:**
The enhanced workflow involving `query_solver.py` will be:
1.  A specific game state (ranges, board, pot, stacks, history, current player to act) is defined. This can come from the output of `range_generator.py` and the initial gamestate CSV.
2.  `query_solver.py` calls the modified Rust FFI function, passing this game state.
3.  The Rust solver executes, performs its game-theoretic calculations, and gathers all the required EV data, opponent strategy profiles, and abstracted card outcome evaluations.
4.  The Rust FFI function serializes this data and returns it to the Python environment.
5.  `query_solver.py` receives this raw data and parses it into a structured Python format (e.g., a dictionary).
6.  This structured data represents the "raw solver output" for that specific game state and decision point. It will then be used as input for a subsequent process that formats it into the "linearized search traces" as described in Section 2 of `internal_search_poker_internal_search_methodology.txt`.

**4. Integration with CSV Processing:**
The `main()` function within `query_solver.py`, which currently reads gamestates from `gamestates.csv` and runs the solver, will be adapted. Instead of merely triggering the solver, it will:
*   Call the enhanced solver FFI function.
*   Retrieve the rich structured data returned by the solver.
*   Process and store this data, likely by writing it to a new output file (e.g., a JSONL file where each line is a JSON object of solver outputs for a gamestate, or an augmented CSV). This file will then serve as the input for the LLM training data preparation pipeline, which constructs the full linearized search traces.

This evolution of `query_solver.py` is critical for bridging the gap between the raw computational power of the poker solver and the specific data requirements for training the internal search LLM.

## Future Considerations/Refinements:

*   Make `PERTURBATION_PARAMS` configurable per `range_type` or `player_role` for more fine-grained control.
*   Implement more sophisticated neighbor identification or addition probabilities in `_perform_perturbation`.
*   Allow for multiple perturbation runs on the same base range to generate several distinct variations for a single scenario.
*   Integrate with a CSV or data source to process multiple gamestates.
