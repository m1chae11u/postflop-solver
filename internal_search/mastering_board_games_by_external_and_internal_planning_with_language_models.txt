While large language models perform well on a range of complex tasks (e.g., text generation, question
answering, summarization), robust multi-step planning and reasoning remains a considerable challenge
for them. In this paper we show that search-based planning can significantly improve LLMs‚Äô playing
strength across several board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex). We
introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external engine, and in internal search,
the model directly generates in-context a linearized tree of potential futures and a resulting final choice.
Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, capturing the transition and
value functions across these games. We find that our pre-training method minimizes hallucinations, as
our model is highly accurate regarding state prediction and legal moves. Additionally, both internal and
external search indeed improve win-rates against state-of-the-art bots, even reaching Grandmaster-level
performance in chess while operating on a similar move count search budget per decision as human
Grandmasters. The way we combine search with domain knowledge is not specific to board games,
suggesting direct extensions into more general language model inference and training techniques.

Introduction
With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread adoption across
diverse application domains and use cases, their
capabilities are under scrutiny. While LLMs perform fluently on text generation, language understanding and translation, they are prone to
hallucinations and reasoning errors, especially in
complex contexts (Chang et al., 2024; Hadi et al.,
2023). Hence, special attention has been given to
the development of planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs (Minaee et al., 2024), and/or to
the agentic systems built on top of LLM subcomponents (Grosnit et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024e).
This reflects both the increasing complexity of AI
application domains, as well as a recognition of
reasoning as a key capability on the path towards
more general artificial intelligence (Huang and
Chang, 2022). In terms of Kahneman‚Äôs cognitive
theory of two systems (Kahneman, 2011), prior

work primarily improved associative System 1 inference in language models, whereas planning
and reasoning now focuses on improving the more
deliberate System 2 thinking (Plaat et al., 2024).
Reasoning in language models encompasses diverse techniques with the aim to improve LLM performance on reasoning benchmarks. Approaches
typically fall into one of two distinct categories: In
internal planning the LLM develops a plan in context, like Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al.,
2022), by autoregressively considering possible
steps towards the goal and their consequences.
By contrast, external planning uses the LLM to
generate steps in a neurosymbolic system, such
as in Tree of Thought (Yao et al., 2024), where
an outer loop performs explicit search over possible sequences of steps. This paper presents how
language models can be trained for internal and
external planning to improve reasoning in sequential decision-making, using board games as an
experimental domain.

Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models

Board games have historically played an important role in the development of automated
decision-making, with Torres‚Äô automaton El Ajedrecista playing three-piece chess end-games
before the advent of digital computation (tor,
November 1915). Games provide diverse reasoning challenges about both environment dynamics
and opponent strategies, and thus have gained
significant attention in pushing the boundaries
of LLM reasoning capabilities (Costarelli et al.,
2024; Duan et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024b). LLMs
have incidentally been struggling with reliably
playing common board games, like chess or even
tic-tac-toe (Topsakal and Harper, 2024). This
may seem somewhat surprising, considering how
much headway has been made in other areas.
However, as games astutely expose the inability of
LLMs to consistently reason over possible futures
with world models, they make a great testbed
for planning and reasoning. Making progress in
game-playing could inform how to best instill this
ability in LLMs going forward. We present several
contributions towards this aspirational goal.
First, we have pre-trained a Transformer model,
the multi action-value (MAV) model, capable of
playing several board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, Hex) at a strong
level. Our evaluation shows that this model is capable of reliably tracking the board state throughout games, and makes (good) legal moves. We
observe nearly no hallucinations (cf. Table 3) with
this model for both in and out-of-distribution positions that are fairly distinct from anything the
model would have seen during training. Our MAV
model builds on top of prior work (Ruoss et al.,
2024) where the ability to train strong text-based
Transformer models in chess without search was
first demonstrated, though those methods would
still require an external tool for providing the list
of legal moves, querying for their values individually. Our MAV model generates all the values and
transitions in a single query, and proposes the list
of candidate moves itself without any external
tool calls. Second, we demonstrate that it is possible to utilize the proposed MAV model within
an external MCTS controller, as a value/implicit
policy and transition function. The MCTS-MAV
agent shows substantial improvements over the
base MAV model in playing strength, showcas-

ing the promise of MCTS as an external search
mechanism in a more general context. Our asynchronous MCTS implementation has been designed to reduce the number of queries to the
model, and we show a comprehensive evaluation
of different variants and scoring methods, in the
low-simulation regime (‚àº100 to ‚àº1k simulations
compared to AlphaZero which used ‚àº10k simulations or engines that use up to millions). Third,
we generalise the approach recently proposed in
Stream of Search (SoS) (Gandhi et al., 2024b)
and show that it is possible to distill the search
procedure directly into the LLM. The resulting
internal search MAV model has the ability to
infer the distilled search procedure in chess. Our
evaluation shows that this method is also capable
of delivering consistent improvements in playing
strength over the MAV baseline with the given
search/token budget. By training on tokens representing various search actions (such as expand,
evaluate, summarize) and game actions (moving
the state ahead), we show a significant improvement when comparing against training on game
actions only, elevating the model‚Äôs skill from imitating search to executing it. We summarize below
our main contributions:
Contribution 1: MAV model. We pre-train
a Transformer model, the multi action-value
model (MAV), capable of playing several
board games (Chess, Chess960, Connect
Four, Hex) at a strong level.
Contribution 2: External search. We
use the MAV model within an external
MCTS controller, as a value/implicit policy and transition function. The agent
reaches Grandmaster level with the number
of moves considered per decision comparable to human players.
Contribution 3: Internal search. We distill directly the search procedure into the
LLM. The resulting agent is able to infer the
search procedure and its performance scales
with the given search budget.

Multi-action-value model
The first contribution of this work is to introduce
the multi-action-value (MAV) model, a Transformer model pre-trained exclusively on textual
game data that functions simultaneously as a: (ùëñ)
world model, (ùëñùëñ) value function, and (ùëñùëñùëñ) policy
function for multiple perfect-information board
games. Acting as world model further requires
the following capabilities: (ùëñ) state-tracking (determining the new state of the game after a move
has been played in the previous state), (ùëñùëñ) legal
move prediction, (ùëñùëñùëñ) terminal state detection. To
achieve this, the MAV model is trained on examples following a flexible format which provides
a strong learning signal and allows for a qualitycompute tradeoff at inference time while remaining in-distribution. An example illustrating the
MAV format can be found in Figure 1.

Command specification. The MAV model input starts with a configuration header containing a series of commands that inform how
to interpret the inputs that follow, and what
outputs are expected. In its simplest form,
this looks like <mav game=$game> %state
%top_1 </mav>, where %state and %top_1
are commands. This tells the model what game
is being played, that the next line ([%state
$state_string]) should be interpreted as the
current state of the game, and that it is responsible for predicting the output top_1 (i.e. the
single best move and its win probability).

State representation. Each game uses a different textual format to represent its state. These
representations are designed such that each
square of the board is tokenized separately, and
squares maintain constant relative positions in
token space. This makes it easier for the model to
navigate and manipulate the board. This is the
format used for the %state and %prev_state
commands. For convenience we also support
the %FEN and %prev_FEN commands for chess,
which instead use the standardized FEN representation. We train our models to be able to handle
%state and %FEN commands interchangeably,
or jointly as in Figure 1. For simplicity, in the

rest of this section we will only use the %state
command.
State tracking. State tracking is achieved
in the MAV model by using the series of
commands
%prev_state %prev_action
%state. These instruct the model that the
following input lines will be [%prev_state
$state_string] containing the previous state,
and [%prev_action $action_string] with
the move played in that state. The model‚Äôs task
is to act as a transition function and output
[%state $new_state_string], describing
the state after the transition.
In addition to predicting the state after the previous action, MAV can also output the state after
the action it decides to take (see %best_action
below).
Starting state. When state tracking is used, the
post-transition state is used as the starting state
for subsequent commands (e.g. %top_1 is evaluated in this state). Otherwise the starting state is
directly specified using the %state command.
Value function. The %top_k command instructs the model to output a list of ùëò legal moves
(or all legal moves if there are fewer than ùëò). The
ability to configure ùëò is useful because it allows
for varying the amount of inference-time computation the MAV model performs. However, it is
also possible to specify ùëò = ‚Äúùëéùëôùëô ‚Äù in order for the
model to produce all legal moves.
Directly following each legal move the model
outputs its action value. This corresponds to the
predicted win probability for the player in the
current state if this move is taken. For chess, stateaction values are represented similarly to Ruoss
et al. (2024): Stockfish centipawn evaluations are
mapped to win probabilities using the formula

to discrete non-overlapping buckets, making the

value prediction problem a classification task
rather than a regression task. This has proven
to be beneficial in other works (Farebrother et al.,
2024). We use 64 buckets, each represented by a
different special token (e.g. <ctrl28> for bucket
28). Figure 2 shows two win probability distributions predicted by the MAV model. Connect Four
and Hex use game engines Fhourstones (Tromp)
and neurobenzene (Gao and Pawlewicz), respectively, to obtain state-action values, which are
similarly mapped to the same 64 bucket tokens.
When producing training examples, we randomly
vary ùëò and include both examples where ùëò is less
than the number of legal moves, and where ùëò
is greater (this teaches the model to not hallucinate additional options). In the former case,
we teach the model to output the ùëò moves that
have the highest win probabilities as predicted by
the game engine. We make the deliberate choice
to randomize the order of the moves. This accomplishes two purposes: (ùëñ) it encourages the
model to treat the moves independently, rather
than relying on a specific order, and (ùëñùëñ) it helps
to prevent hallucinations. If the moves were e.g.
sorted lexicographically from ùëé1ùëé2 to ‚Ñé8‚Ñé7, then
(ùëñ) if the model skips a legal move ùëé1ùëé4 and emits
ùëé1ùëé5, there is no hope that it will correct its mistake, and (ùëñùëñ) the model might learn to systematically lean on evaluations of previous moves
when considering ‚Ñé8‚Ñé7, potentially causing the
model to play better/worse on the left side of the
board. Using randomised ordering of moves in
the training data, the model is steered towards
an approximate permutation symmetry (Bronstein
et al., 2021).

MAV assigns little uncertainty and gives a win

In contrast, the bishop sacrifice Bxh7+ (best move

and thus has substantial probability mass around
low, equal, and high win probabilities.

Value Definition: Scoring Methods. As mentioned above, there are 64 buckets used to encode
the range of a value, each represented by a unique
token. As we reserve these 64 tokens exclusively
for encoding values, the actual state-action value
for a move is derived from its token distribution.
Hence, it can also be viewed as a decoding strategy for the values. We refer to different ways to
represent values as scoring methods. We experiment with two scoring methods: max scoring,
which corresponds to greedy decoding, uses the
mode of model‚Äôs distribution over the 64 buckets
to represent the value, and mean scoring, which
takes into account the whole distribution defining
the value as an expectation over buckets.
Mean scoring often enables us to differentiate

4

Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models

between multiple candidate actions with equal
modes. For example, there are many positions
where multiple moves will likely result in a draw
but certain moves retain higher winning chances
than others. In such cases, max scoring would
not be able to differentiate between these moves,
while mean scoring would pick the move with the
highest expected winning chances.
The mean scoring method was also used in Ruoss et al. (2024); the main difference here is that
MAV does not take the move as an input to be
scored, but rather decodes the values for all moves
in a single output generation.
Legal moves and terminal states. It‚Äôs worth
noting that %top_k also handles functionality
specifically related to MAV being a world model.
First, the model does not need to be provided
with a list of legal moves, and instead predicts
the list by itself. Second, if the state is terminal,
the %top_k output specifies the game outcome
(e.g. [%top_1 invalid : "1-0"] when the
first player has won).
Best action prediction. In positions where the
acting player has a decisive advantage, multiple
moves may be assigned a 100% win probability,
and therefore all map to the same bucket. Some of
these moves may not directly lead to finishing the
game by checkmate, causing the model to play
aimlessly in winning positions. This problem was
encountered in Ruoss et al. (2024), which they
resolved by using Stockfish to break ties when
all top 5 moves lie above a win probability of
99%. We seek to completely eliminate reliance
on game engines at inference time. To accomplish this, we introduce the %best_action command, which must follow the %top_k command.
If present, the model outputs [%best_action
$move], where $move corresponds to Stockfish‚Äôs chosen action in the position. Essentially,
the model learns the tie-breaking procedure described above.
Novelty. To summarize how the MAV model
differs from previous Transformer-based chess
engines, the MAV model makes four key improve-

ments over the existing state-of-the-art (Farebrother et al., 2024; Monroe and Leela Chess
Zero Team, 2024; Ruoss et al., 2024)
‚Ä¢ First, it performs world modeling, policy and
action-value computation together in one
model.
‚Ä¢ Second, it is trained to output the best action
at the end of action-value modeling. This
enables the model to finish games even in
the presence of multiple actions with equal
values but with some of the actions not bringing the game closer to a finish. Importantly,
these first two improvements enable the MAV
model to play complete games without relying on an external game engine for legal
moves or for finishing the game.
‚Ä¢ Third, all of the above steps can be done in
a single model call without having to evaluate every action separately‚Äîan important
feature that guided the design of the MAV
format to reduce the cost and infrastructural
complexity of inference.
‚Ä¢ Fourth, the amount of compute performed
by the model at inference time can be varied. This enables us to achieve higher quality
at the cost of higher latency when performing both internal and external search, where
the performance increases as we scale the
planning.

Datasets. We curate a dataset of diverse, relevant positions in four games: Chess, FisherRandom Chess, Connect Four, and Hex. The statistics and sources for each of these datasets are
shown in Table 1. Each position is used to produce
a single training example, randomly varying (ùëñ)
the ùëò action values in %top_k, (ùëñùëñ) the presence of
the initial or final state tracking commands, (ùëñùëñùëñ)
the use and order of %state or %FEN representations in chess. Further details on the datasets
are provided in the Appendix.

Models. We train two randomly initialized
decoder-only Transformer models using the Gemini architecture (Gemini Team et al., 2024), called
MAV and MAV‚Äìsmall, with 2.7 billion and 1 bil-

on 1.9 and 1.2 epochs of the dataset described
in Table 1. Except for the max scoring result for
MAV‚Äìsmall in table 2, all other experiments and
results use the 2.7 billion MAVmodel. In order to
efficiently use our models‚Äô parameters, the input
part of each training example is masked out during loss computation. This means our models do
not waste capacity on learning to generate game
positions.

External Search
External search employs the MAV model to generate planning steps, and applies a search algorithm
to direct and optimise over sequences of planning
steps. In this paper, we evaluate planning on top
of the previously discussed MAV model, using
MCTS as the search procedure.

MCTS (Silver et al., 2017). There are two key ingredients: a prior function which returns a probability distribution over actions at each state, and
a value function returning a numerical value indicating value of a state or state-action pair, both
extracted from the MAV output. External search
is an adaptation of MCTS; in its most basic form,
as in AlphaZero, MCTS relies on an explicit world
model, querying a game engine (e.g., a chess implementation in OpenSpiel (Lanctot et al., 2019))
to provide legal actions, state transitions and terminal state signals. Inspired by MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), in a subsection below we
describe how we remove this dependency on the
game engine and instead use only the model to
track states, transitions, and provide legal actions
and game outcome during planning.
The external search algorithm guided by a
learned world model is summarized in Algorithm 1, with subroutines and details contained
in the Appendix. A search is started at an initial game state ùë†0 . First, the legal actions ùíÇ0ùêø and
associated state-action values ùë∏ ( ùëñ ) ( ùë†0 , ùíÇ0ùêø ) from active player‚Äôs ùëñ perspective are obtained from the
MAV model. The prior function is an ùúÄ-greedy
policy, derived entirely from state-action values
comprised of a greedy softmax over the top ùëò
values, mixed with a uniform distribution over
all actions to encourage exploration. Specifically,
let ùíÇùëî,ùëò ‚äÜ ùíÇùêø be the subset of legal actions ùíÇùêø
whose values are among the top ùëò-ranked values,
or equal to ùíÇùêø if | ùíÇùêø | ‚â§ ùëò. Define the probability
of action ùëé in state ùë† under the greedy policy to
be

values to win probabilities before computing softmax.

The root node N0 is then initialized with the
active player, string description of a state corresponding to the node, and legal actions (respectively: N0 ( ùëñ), N0 ( ùë†), N0 ( ùíÇùêø )). The node is then
expanded so that a child node is added for each
action and a prior probability attached to the action leading to the child. Then simulations are
run (Algorithm 3 in the Appendix): each simulation starts at the root node, actions and children
nodes are selected according to PUCT until a leaf
node is expanding and evaluated, and values are
backpropagated through the nodes that the simulation visited. After ùêæ such simulations, a final
move ùëé‚àó is selected. Besides the integration of the
prior, value, and transition functions through the
MAV model, and the asynchronous simulations
described below, this most basic form of external search is based on a fairly common implementation of AlphaZero-style MCTS using PUCT
for action selection (Silver et al., 2017) adapted
from the generic one in OpenSpiel (Lanctot et al.,
2019).
External Search with State-Tracking MAV
Classical MCTS relies on several components of a
game engine to simulate the game. MAV replaces
these components by combining state tracking, legal action prediction, action value prediction, and
terminal state detection in a single model. This
allows us to remove the dependency on a game
engine, which results in a few benefits. First,
we use the board games to showcase that MCTS
achieves astonishing performance even without
access to an explicit world model, which is the
case for many interesting real-world problems.
Second, it is a step closer towards the internal
search with LLMs.
We adapt MCTS (see Algorithm 1) to use the
learned MAV model to predict the state transition from the string description of a parent node
Nùë° ‚àí1 ( ùë†) and action ùëéùë° ‚àí1 to the child node Nùë° , as
shown in Figure 3. We use the obtained information to store a (predicted) string description ùë†ùë°

The MAV model may hallucinate and return
responses that are improperly-formatted. To address this, for each game, a parser function is responsible for translating the output into the next
state, legal actions, and their values. If the parsing fails ‚Äì which can only happen if a response
violates a predefined format ‚Äì then the evaluation at the node is marked as a hallucination and
a special value of ‚àí‚àû is assigned to the node to
avoid future consideration. This procedure makes
state-tracking MCTS robust to hallucinations, by
explicitly avoiding states where the hallucination
occurred.

than an optimized deep convolutional network
(such as the ones used in MuZero (Schrittwieser
et al., 2020)), keeping the elapsed time for an
MCTS search to a reasonable level can be a challenge. The inference time of a single model call
dominates the time take for a search, so we aim
to keep the total calls low. Since the prior and
value for a new node are both obtained for the
MAV, there is at most one model call per simulation of MCTS. In the low simulation count regime
that we operate in, reusing the search trees is a
simple optimization that reduces the number of
server calls by 5-10% in our experiments.
Despite this lower number of inference calls,
it can still be costly to make many model calls.
Hence, we run an asynchronous version of MCTS
that is conceptually very similar to Algorithm 1,
but with the main loop (between lines 7‚Äì9)
changed. An overview is shown in Figure 4.
Parallel MCTS implementations usually rely on
virtual losses (Chaslot et al., 2008; Mirsoleimani
et al., 2017) to avoid multiple threads choosing
the same simulation paths down due to deterministic action choices. Our asynchronous MCTS
introduces three new parameters:
Batch size ùëè. The number of simulations, each
leading to an evaluation (model call), that
are done asynchronously at any given time.
Timeout ùë°0 . The amount of time to wait for evaluations. After the timeout expires, any evaluations that have not returned are discarded.

In Asynchronous MCTS, simulations are instead
performed in batches. First, ùëè downward passes
are performed serially to queue ùëè evaluations. The
ùëè evaluations are performed in parallel and the
MAV outputs are returned asynchronously.
The evaluations are then processed one-by-one
as they return. For each queued evaluation that
was successful (i.e., did not time out), its values
are then backpropagated up the tree (serially).
The state-action pairs that are visited before the
queuing of evaluations are assigned temporary
virtual counts: their visit counts are temporary set
to ùëÅ ( ùë†, ùëé) = ùëÅ ( ùë†, ùëé) + ùëõùëê . The visit counts and virtual counts are then subtracted upon the upward
pass, i.e., ùëÅ ( ùë†, ùëé) = ùëÅ ( ùë†, ùëé) ‚àí ùëõùëê .
Note that, since the simulations and processing of evaluations (backpropagation) are both
done serially, there is no need for complex concurrency handling primitives such as mutexes or
semaphores. In practice, the implementation is
based on Python‚Äôs concurrent.futures module and re-uses most of the serial MCTS subroutines, changing only the main loop.
Dynamic Virtual Counts In our low simulation
count settings, using the virtual losses accompanied by the fixed virtual counts ùëõùëê did not strike a
satisfactory balance between exploration and exploitation. To circumvent this obstacle, we introduce the dynamic virtual counts that dynamically
assign more weight to the virtual count values
closer to the leaf nodes. Suppose simulation ùëö
encounters leaf node Nùëô . We define a virtual count
for states-action pairs ( ùë†ùë° , ùëéùë° ) visited in simulation
ùëö and leaf Nùëô

is then halved at each parent up to the root node
while maintining a minimum virtual count ùëõmin .

The training data is based on target search
trees, which were constructed using depth 3 (N.B.,
depth-zero is MAV), by annotating states (e.g.
chess states being annotated with Stockfish), and
expanding the top 5 moves into trees. This results in high quality target search trees, similar
to those internally generated by engines such as
Leela or Stockfish. To diversify training data and
enable search budget control for trained models,
prompts were composed with diverse search parameters, ranging depth 1‚Äì3 and breadth 2‚Äì5,
and continuations yield corresponding trees that
were subsampled to match the parameters while
fitting into context size. This necessitated excluding the biggest parameter combination (i.e.,
omitting depth 3, breadth 5 examples).
An example internal search trace predicted by
the trained model, along with the corresponding
search tree, are shown in Figure 6.
Training details. We leveraged the pre-trained
MAV model and fine-tuned it using a mixture of
60% MAV data and 40% search data. Fine-tuning
was run for 20,000 steps, using a batch size of
512.

Internal Search
In contrast to external search, in internal search
the model does not require an external controller.
Instead, the search procedure is distilled into the
model so that it is capable of (ùëñ) evaluating search
nodes (states), (ùëñùëñ) expanding nodes while updating the current state, and (ùëñùëñùëñ) backpropagating
the results from leaf nodes back to the root node‚Äî
all within a single model call. The distillation is
done by linearizing search trees into a text format
and training the model on those linearized trees.
Data. The prompt for internal search resembles
that of the MAV models, but includes a preamble
with search parameters (tree depth and breadth,
see Figure 6). The format of the target data is
inspired by depth-first order traversal of minimax
trees, as an iterative and linearized sequence of
minimax tree traversal. Hence, following this
format corresponds to an algorithmic execution

Experiments
Evaluation
Evaluating large language models in general and
reasoning specifically is a broad field (Chang et al.,
2024), within which games have been established
as an evaluation benchmark (Costarelli et al.,
2024; Duan et al., 2024). We evaluate language
models in a games league which runs our agents
in head-to-head match-ups, sampling combinations uniformly at random from a pool of agents.
We report internal Elo ratings (relative Elo only
between members of the population) as well as
external Elo ratings in cases where some of our
agents have externally reported Elos.
For chess evaluation, we rely on the state-of-theart engine Stockfish at different playing strengths
to estimate the widely used external Elo rating.
This is done by calibrating the internal Elo with

MAV outperforms Ruoss et al. (2024), perhaps
due to being trained explicitly on Chess960 data.

Generalization. During the opening and
endgame, human players often rely on memorized opening lines and endgame theory, while
middlegame requires more calculation and
intuition. We can see the same pattern in the
games of MAV (see Figure 8). Overall, 10% of
the positions played by MAV in evaluation appear
in its training data, while between moves 20 and
50, virtually no position has been seen by MAV
during training. These results show that in order

Finally, we show an example of MAV‚Äôs generalization capabilities into a position which does
not appear in the training data. In the position
shown in Figure 9, MAV has found a creative
move, g5, which is the best move according to
Stockfish. The move allows the White knight on
f3 to capture the pawn but results in a long-term
advantage for Black.

For our external-MCTS agents, we tune hyperparameters using a combination of manual and
head-to-head comparisons. We found that setting ùúè = 1.0, ùëò = 5, and ùúÄ = 0.1 worked best
for the prior. Please see the appendix for details.
For Async MCTS we used a batch size ùëè = 16.
We found that lower batch sizes were always
preferred in terms of performance. After hyperparameter tuning, we used dynamic virtual count
values ùëõmin = 2 in all cases, and ùëõmax varying with
the number of simulations: ( ùëÄ, ùëõmax ) ‚àà {(100, 8),
(250, 8), (500, 8), (1000, 16), (2000, 32)}. We
also include a basic MCTS baseline, which refers
to MCTS with a uniform prior and random rollouts run with 100 simulations.
We first analyze the performance of the scoring
method for the value function when used within
MAV‚ÄìMCTS . We do this by running a large tournament amount all MAV‚ÄìMCTS variants, various
levels of Stockfish, MAV on its own, and basic
MCTS. MAV‚ÄìMCTS with mean scoring performs
better in all cases, with a 25-69 difference in Elo.
Hence, for the remainder of the external search
experiments, we report results only for the mean
scoring method. The full results are shown in
Figure 10 in the appendix.
We then run a similar tournament including

12

Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models

Ext-BoN: the results are shown in Table 2. The
total number of games played in each respective
tournament were 14689 for standard chess, 4480
for chess960, 2189 for Connect Four, and 6334
for Hex. In chess, MAV‚ÄìMCTS with just 100 simulations achieves an internal Elo 68 higher than the
base MAV model in chess, and generally performance rises consistently with more simulations,
up to 340 internal Elo improvement at 2000 simulations. This is also illustrated in Figure 7a, which
demonstrates that Elo improves logarithmically
as a function of the number of simulations.
In the case of Chess960, every game begins
with a random position (among a preset 960 initial positions). We obtain comparable results to
chess.
In the case of Connect Four, we notice that MAV‚Äì
MCTS is particularly helpful in improving upon
the base model. All external search agents improve by at least 244 Elo upon the base model. In
Connect Four, we notice that improvements consistently rise with added simulations, albeit with
smaller performance differences between simulation counts compared to chess. In Connect Four,
we notice a relatively smaller performance gain
between basic MCTS and the MAV model, and
larger improvements between the MAV model
and external search.
Since our final model was not adequately
trained with state-tracking capabilities for Hex,
in the Hex results only a game engine is used
to determine terminal states, legal actions, and
state transitions. In contrast to Connect Four, we
notice a large improvement between basic MCTS
and the MAV model in Hex, and improvements
similar to chess from search. We suspect that this
is due to the relative complexity of the games,
but more research is needed to clarify the reason for these differences. It should be possible to
support the engine-free logic in Hex similarly to
chess going forward. Across all games, external
MCTS performs consistently better as the number
of simulations is increased.
Internal search results
For our internal search experiments, we vary the
depth and breadth parameters of the minimax

search, up to breadth 4 and depth 2. We map
these different configurations into token counts
by computing the average length of the prompt +
response per configuration in our training data.
Figure 7b shows the performance of the model
as the function of token counts. We can see that
playing strength, measured by external Elo2 , increases with the search budget.
For an example of how internal search can improve playing strength, see Figure 6. In this example, the initial MAV section of the response
predicts qd6 as the best move. However, as the
internal search continues, the model is able to
find a better move qXg6 after exploring the top3 lines one step further. This points to the model‚Äôs
ability to self-correct, which is an important capability of LLMs that can reason (Kumar et al.,
2024).

Discussions and limitations
Despite promising results in the domain of perfect
information board games indicating the potential
of external and internal planning with LLMs, our
initial study makes a number of assumptions that
future work may need to address ‚Äì namely, the
ability to acquire or generate large quantities of
game play data, as well as the availability of reliable solvers or game engines that can be used to
annotate this data in order to create an appropriate training curriculum for the model. We have
also yet to fully explore the distillation of more
complex search procedures, which may introduce
additional challenges.
Another important limitation of our MAV models is that they have been trained exclusively on
game data, and therefore do not possess the ability to communicate verbally using natural language. However, there should be no fundamental
obstacles in achieving the same ability in potentially larger models that may also incorporate
natural language data, as we train on the exact
2 For the internal search experiments, we didn‚Äôt play

games until checkmate but stopped them once either side
had reached a decisive, 1200+ centipawn advantage. This
was done since the internal search training data did not
train the model to predict the quickest win, which would
sometimes result in the model aimlessly moving around
pieces in winning positions.

Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models

same architecture and tokenizer used in classical
text-based LLMs.
Meanwhile, we argue that there is potential
utility in the separation of responsibilities within
a larger system, and we demonstrate that it is
possible to utilise the proposed models as tools
within a larger generalist model, calling the specialist model through a natural language tool-use
interface with an appropriately formatted input
(objective, game dynamics, game state) and output (choice, justification). Specialist models may
also be used as teachers for distilling their knowledge into generalists (Bounsi et al., 2024).
It remains an open question how to design good
value functions for general conversational task,
and how to incorporate these value functions or
other highly specialized knowledge in training
such that the model can draw upon them flexibly
at inference time, in a wide variety of conversational contexts.

Conclusions
This paper demonstrates the capacity of LLMs to
learn strong value functions and act as a world
model across multiple perfect information games.
This enables their use in MCTS, where we observe
significant performance gains of approximately
+300 Elo points even with a fairly limited search
budget. Going further, we find that training on
search traces enables the model to learn an effective search procedure that can be executed via a
single model call. This adds to the rapidly growing body of literature highlighting the promise of
planning and reasoning with LLMs.

dependency for the simplicity of notation
‚Ä¢ N0 : a root node; stores internal objects
‚Äì an active player N0 ( ùëñ) ‚àà {0, 1}
‚Äì a string description of the initial state N0 ( ùë†) = ùë†0
‚Äì a list of legal actions N0 ( ùíÇùêø ) = ùíÇ0ùêø
‚Ä¢ ùëÑ ( ùëñ ) ( ùë†ùë° , ùëéùë° ): a state-action value from the perspective of player ùëñ in state ùë†ùë° given action ùëéùë°
‚Ä¢ ùë∏ ( ùëñ ) ( ùë†ùë° , ùíÇùë°ùêø ) = ( ùëÑ ( ùëñ ) ( ùë†ùë° , ùëé1ùë° ) , . . . , ùëÑ ( ùëñ ) ( ùë†ùë° , ùëéùë°ùêø ( ùë†ùë° ) )): a state-action value from the perspective of player
ùëñ in state ùë†ùë° for all legal moves ùíÇùë°ùêø
‚Ä¢ ùëÉ ( ùë†ùë° , ùëéùë° ) = ‚Ñô( ùëéùë° | ùë†ùë° ): a prior probability of action ùëéùë° in state ùë†ùë°
‚Ä¢ ùë∑ ( ùë†ùë° , ùíÇùë°ùêø ) = ( ùëÉ ( ùë†ùë° , ùëé1ùë° ) , . . . , ùëÉ ( ùë†ùë° , ùëéùë°ùêø ( ùë†ùë° ) )): a prior distribution, i.e., a distribution over all legal moves
ùíÇùë°ùêø in state ùë†ùë°
‚Ä¢ Nùë° : a node at step ùë° > 0; stores internal objects

External Engines and Game Data
Stockfish For chess and Chess960 we used the open source engine Stockfish 16 (Source Code Avalible
on Github) for both annotations and as opponents in our internal Elo calculations. We compiled all
Stockfish builds from source, using clang++, with the following compile flags -O3 -DIS_64BIT
-DUSE_PTHREADS -mprefer-vector-width=128 for all builds. We ran Stockfish over a wide
array of hardware using two different configurations, for older hardware we added -DUSE_POPCNT
-DUSE_SSSE3 -DUSE_SSE41 -march=westmere -msse4.2 and for newer hardware we added
-DUSE_AVX2 -DUSE_PEXT -march=haswell. These builds usually give us between 350k-700k
nodes per second for single threaded runs of stockfish ‚Äì bench 4096 1 130000 default
nodes.
Ext-BoN (Ruoss et al., 2024) showed that a small (270M-parameter) transformer can play Blitz
chess on Lichess at an Elo of 2895 against humans (i.e., Grandmaster level). They created a large-scale
dataset of 10 million chess games with legal move and value annotations (15 billion data points)
provided by Stockfish 16, the state-of-the-art chess engine. They then trained Transformers via

supervised learning to predict action-values, i.e., no explicit search, and showed that their models
achieve highly non-trivial generalization (e.g., solving challenging chess puzzles). They thus showed
that a remarkably good approximation of Stockfish‚Äôs search-based algorithm can be distilled into
large-scale transformers via supervised learning, but that perfect distillation is still beyond reach.

Chess/Chess960 Game Training Data Chess positions were drawn from two sources: Lichess
and TCEC. TCEC data consisted of all 34,291 standard chess games played in seasons 1-25, from
which 4,204,025 unique positions were extracted. Lichess standard rated chess games were drawn
from the months October 2014, March 2017, and January 2020 for a total of 58,705,532 games. All
19,758,457 Chess960 games played on Lichess from August 2013 to June 2024 were included. All
positions were annotated with Stockfish 16 for a duration of 1 second, with the exception of those
drawn from TCEC and Lichess October 2014 games, where 15 seconds of analysis time was used.

Hex Training Data 12,279,645 Hex games were generated by self-play with neurobenzene (Gao
and Pawlewicz), run with search time set to 10 seconds. In 10% of positions, a random move was
chosen instead to encourage exploration of an otherwise narrow state space distribution.

Connect Four Training Data 2,458,293 Connect Four games were generated using an ùúÄ-greedy
strategy with ùúÄ = 40%. Greedy actions were chosen uniformly among all moves that yielded the best
attainable minimax value, computed using the Fhourstones solver (Tromp).

Games league
We conduct planning and reasoning experiments in games, similar to GameBench (Costarelli et al.,
2024) and GTBench (Duan et al., 2024). Games present an opportunity to develop and test approaches
in a controllable and safe environment, with ground truth that is readily verifiable through existing
game models. We use OpenSpiel (Lanctot et al., 2019) as the game engine to drive our evaluations.
Decision-making with language agents inseparably fuses a prompting strategy, the language model,
and the response interpretation. The language model essentially interfaces with a second modality
‚Äì the game, for which prompting encodes the state observation as language input, and response
interpretation maps from language output back to action. The language model performs the response
computation in language space. Any given triplet can be evaluated on specific states, or by playing
against another triplet or against benchmark bots (e.g. Random, search or reinforcement learning
based agents) that operate directly on the game representation.
We evaluate agents offline, through fixed datasets of states, and online, in pairwise matches against
reference opponents. Metrics such as action-choice quantiles and action-value regret that we compute
for each dataset across agents are directly comparable, and exhibit different skill dimensions (tasks),
such as doing well in opening, mid-game or endgame positions. In contrast, online matches directly
measure relative playing strength as wins/draws/losses, and may traverse different distributions of
states for each match-up of opponents. While the eventual objective is to increase playing strength
across a wide range of opponents, the offline evaluation on datasets helps characterise each policy.
A tournament of multiple opponents results in square agent-vs-agent matrices indicating the number
of wins and draws (losses inferable from transposed of wins) for each pair. Elo (Elo, 1967) finds the
best single-dimensional rating for each contender, such that their mutual win probabilities are best
explained by a ratio of their exponentiated rating. This implies a ranking, i.e., an ordinal preference
over each of the contenders. We report average winrates (treating draws as half wins) for matches,
and Elo for tournaments.

Out-of-Distribution test set positions
We programmatically generate out-of-distribution (OOD) positions by randomly sampling the number
and type of pieces on the board while ensuring compliance with several rules such as: kings cannot be
in check simultaneously, or the position is not a checkmate. Examples of OOD positions are shown in
Figure 11. Notice that some positions are not reachable via a legal sequence of moves from the initial
chess position, which showcases that MAV generalizes outside of the human games it was trained on
by achieving near 100% accuracy as reported in Table 3.

Related work
Planning and reasoning with language models is both an open challenge and an active area of research.
Given how widely relevant planning is as a capability to support decision making in complex, dynamic,
and open-ended domains (Rasal and Hauer, 2024), there is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a correspondingly
wide variety of planning approaches that have been explored to date, mapping onto these unmet
needs. The remainder of this section first outlines general reasoning benchmarks, and then goes

into game benchmarks in particular. Next, we outline adjacent works of in-context reasoning, which
shares with internal search that plans are expanded by the language model itself, and reasoning as
search, which sketches a broader scope around approaches similar to external search. Finally, we
give pointers to specific works as chess, which takes a prominent role in our evaluation.

Benchmarking reasoning Reasoning tasks can be divided into tasks of common sense reasoning (Cui et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024), structured reasoning (Wang et al., 2024b), mathematical
reasoning (Chen et al., 2024a; Gu et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024b; Tang et al., 2024b; Wang et al.,
2024d; Wu et al., 2024c; Zhang et al., 2024c), algorithmic reasoning (Markeeva et al., 2024), symbolic
reasoning (Fang et al., 2024), causal reasoning (Jin et al., 2024), temporal reasoning (Xiong et al.,
2024), meta-reasoning (Zeng et al., 2024) and strategic reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024d). Multimodal
reasoning may span any subset of these categories, with the added complexity of incorporating
cross-modal tasks (Chia et al., 2024; Haresh et al., 2024; Kil et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024a; Shi
et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024a). There are also multilingual benchmarks (Bang et al., 2023; Wang
et al., 2024c), aimed at evaluating model reasoning across languages. Large language models can

29

Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models

approach these reasoning tasks directly, or with help of external tools (Lu et al., 2024; Paranjape
et al., 2023) or planners and solvers (Borazjanizadeh and Piantadosi, 2024; Dagan et al., 2023), and
their performance can be evaluated in typical scenarios or puzzles (Giadikiaroglou et al., 2024; Li
et al., 2024b), which tend to be more complex and more out-of-distribution. These evaluations can
either be general or more domain-specific (Guo et al., 2024; Nori et al., 2024). There have also been
efforts aimed at evaluating the utility of language models as world models, from the perspective of
decision making and planning (Yang et al., 2024a).
Reasoning in games Strategic reasoning (Gandhi et al., 2023), which naturally arises in game
play, is particularly challenging due to a dynamic environment and the uncertainty in predicting the
actions of the adversary. It is goal-oriented, interactive, adaptive, and requires a level of predictive
ability. Outside of games, this type of reasoning may be valuable in economic (Horton, 2023; Li et al.,
2023) and social (Gandhi et al., 2024a; Ziems et al., 2024) applications. The focus in this paper
is primarily on strategic planning in games, which have been suggested as a an important set of
benchmarks for developing and evaluating strategic reasoning (Costarelli et al., 2024; Duan et al.,
2024; Tsai et al., 2023a) in language models, not unlike their historical role in the development
of AI previously (Ensmenger, 2012; McCarthy, 1990; Schaul et al., 2011), and sequential decision
making in particular. Two particular game benchmarks that have been concurrently developed with
this paper are GameBench (Costarelli et al., 2024) and GTBench (Duan et al., 2024). Both adopt the
same agentification of language models for games: an agent comprises a prompting strategy that
generates a prompt from a game state, an LLM that generates the response, and an interpretation of
the textual response as a game action. The resulting agent can be evaluated by playing matches in
specific games, like tic-tac-toe, either against benchmark RL agents or other language model agents.
This makes it possible to draw conclusions on strategic reasoning abilities from the pairwise winrates
or rankings derived from Elo-rating the tournament results. Our specific evaluation is delineated in
the experimental section of this paper.
Reasoning in-context It has been demonstrated that large language models encode a certain level
of intrinsic reasoning ability in the natural language space, especially when prompted to do so (Plaat
et al., 2024), which can be solicited by chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques (Kojima et al., 2022; Shi
et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024f; Wei et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023), least-to-most prompting (Zhou
et al., 2022), plan-and-solve prompting (Wang et al., 2023), self-ask structured prompting (Press
et al., 2022), multi-step problem decomposition and plan execution (Nguyen and Shareghi, 2024),
few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Gramopadhye et al., 2024), and many-shot
prompting (Agarwal et al., 2024), among others. Yet, CoT methods are not always reliable, may
express inconsistent reasoning steps or traces that do not actually correspond to how the decisions are
reached (Turpin et al., 2024; Ye and Durrett, 2022), may not be robust to typographical errors (Gan
et al., 2024), and may not be the best approach for planning in more complex domains, though it
has recently been shown that they can in principle handle e.g. dynamic programming tasks (Feng
et al., 2024a). Without a world model capable of tracking state transitions, it is hard to evaluate
the long-term consequences of earlier decisions (Hao et al., 2023). These emerging capabilities are
heavily influenced by the data itself, as intermediate reasoning steps are only helpful in case of locally
structured data, consisting of local clusters of variables with strong mutual influence (Prystawski
et al., 2024). CoT rationales can be optimised through task-oriented feedback (Lee et al., 2024).
Informative thought templates can be distilled from and reused across a number of different tasks,
and compiled in a buffer of thoughts (Yang et al., 2024b). Diversity in CoT generations matters,
and generating a larger number of diverse reasoning chains can lead to better performance (Zhang
et al., 2022). Reasoning traces can be interleaved with actions, as in ReAct (Yao et al., 2022). Self-

30

Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models

consistency techniques present another avenue for further improving model performance (Wang
et al., 2022). To be useful, CoT prompts may need to be specific to their problem class (Stechly
et al., 2024). Synthetic data generation can be used to improve the quality and the coverage of
demonstrations (Shao et al., 2023). CoT has also been considered in the multimodal context (Lu
et al., 2022; Mitra et al., 2024) and whiteboard-of-thought was recently shown to be helpful, in
encouraging reasoning across modalities (Menon et al., 2024). Language models are capable of
improving their performance on some types of problems merely by the extra computation granted
by the additional tokens, even when those are filter tokens rather than structured or interpretable
CoT (Pfau et al., 2024). It is possible to consider instead generating internal thoughts, as rationales
at the token level for predicting future tokens, demonstrated by the Quiet-STAR method (Zelikman
et al., 2024). This method belongs to a class of approaches that utilise self-improvement or self-play
for boosting the planning and reasoning ability in language models, which has become a widely
used approach (Aksitov et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024c; Hosseini et al., 2024; Saab et al., 2024;
Singh et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024; Zelikman et al., 2022). Self-improvement approaches often
rely on the intrinsic ability for self-correction in LLMs, yet self-correcting reasoning without explicit
external feedback remains difficult (Huang et al., 2024). Given that CoT reasoning is ultimately
greedy and may have problems when there are many options worth exploring (Saparov and He,
2022), this was a motivation for exploring alternative, more structured search methods. Dynamic
prompt-conditional strategy selection may help identify the best strategic approach to each particular
problem (Parekh et al., 2024). Multi-agent approaches can be used to further develop this particular
point, decoupling strategic reasoning and more specific step-wise planning (Wang et al., 2024a).
Planning can also be done over associated knowledge graphs (Chen et al., 2024b), and graph learning
may help with the overall planning capabilities in the more general case (Wu et al., 2024b). Finally,
some problems may lend themselves more naturally to backward planning, potentially necessitating
a custom approach (Ren et al., 2024).
Reasoning as search Testing LLMs on especially sequential decision-making problems requires
agentification, with a variety of proposed approaches to use LLMs as or within game agents (Hu
et al., 2024b,c; Tsai et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2024a). MCTS-based planning, and self-play, have
been also been explored in this context (Light et al., 2024; Putta et al., 2024; Rebstock et al., 2024).
Rather than relying on individual reasoning chains, it is possible to instead construct a tree of
thoughts (Long, 2023; Yao et al., 2024) a graph of thoughts (Besta et al., 2024), or a diagram of
thoughts (Zhang et al., 2024e). There has also been recent interest in utilizing MCTS with LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks (Zhang et al., 2024a). The everything-of-thoughts (XoT) (Ding et al., 2023)
approach utilizes MCTS for incorporating external domain knowledge into thoughts, as does Tree-ofTraversals (Markowitz et al., 2024), enabling language models to effectively reason over facts encoded
in knowledge graphs. Tree search has also proved valuable in completing realistic web tasks (Koh
et al., 2024), as well as code generation (Li et al., 2024a), mathematical reasoning (Jiang et al., 2024),
and tabular data handling (Ji et al., 2024). While most approaches rely on the prompted LLM itself
acting as a value function, therefore bounding the utility of search by the quality of that value function
approximation (Chen et al., 2024d), and searching at low depths, it is also possible to use tree search
with a learned value function in guiding LLM decoding, as was demonstrated in TS-LLM (Feng et al.,
2024b). Language Agent Tree Seatch (LATS) (Zhou et al., 2024) incorporates MCTS along with
self-reflection and memory, achieving strong performance on programming tasks. MCTS has also been
used to improve LLM reasoning ability through iterative preference optimization (Xie et al., 2024b).
When applied in the language generation space, MCTS can be seen as a likelihood-based search on
the direct preference optimization (DPO) policy (Rafailov et al., 2024). MCTS can also be used to
strategically plan over the the problem-solving trajectories for zero-shot in-context learning (Tang et al.,
2024a). Self-Rewarding Tree Search based on MCTS has been used for improving domain-specific

31

Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models

retrieval-augmented generation (Hu et al., 2024a). In terms of other search strategies, Searchformer
has recently been proposed, a Transformer model that was trained to mimic the dynamics of the
ùê¥‚àó algorithm, showing good performance on Sokoban puzzles and in maze navigation. Algorithm
distillation has recently been proposed as a method for distilling reinforcement learning algorithms
into neural networks, facilitating in-context reinforcement learning with language models (Laskin
et al., 2022).
Reasoning in chess As our paper explores the application of planning with language models to chess,
which has been a separate topic of interest, here we also briefly review the current state of art and the
approaches and evaluations relevant to chess in particular. Chess-GPT (Feng et al., 2023) was a custom
model, integrating chess playing and language ability, that was shown to offer notable improvements
in board state tracking and playing strength over a number of LLM baselines. More recently, it was
shown to be possible to train Transformer models to Grandmaster-level strength in chess (Ruoss et al.,
2024), without search, looking just a single move ahead. There have been recent advances involving
diffusion models as well (Anonymous, 2024). By training specialized Transformer models for chess,
it has been shown that the models may demonstrate transcendence (Zhang et al., 2024b), at least
at lower playing strengths ‚Äì where the resulting model may outperform any of the human players
from the training set, as the model learns a policy that effectively averages out some of the mistakes
human players make. This is in line with the findings showing that weak-to-strong supervision is
possible (Burns et al., 2023). It is also possible to develop skill-compatible models (Hamade et al.,
2024), as skill compatibility is ultimately distinct from playing strength. There is also an interest in
developing models that can act as chess coaches (Menon, 2023). There is evidence that chess-playing
Transformers can learn and internalize look-ahead in relation to future optimal moves (Jenner et al.,
2024). An in-depth analysis of chess playing strength of the most prominent language models (Acher,
2023) had identified gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct as the strongest model at the time, capable of completing
longer games and winning against non-trivial Stockfish difficulty levels, yet still failing to finish a
non-negligible percentage of games due to illegal moves.

16. a4 At the first glance, this move aims to
stop b5 and queenside development, but the
move also has a much deeper idea Rg8 17.
Ra3 Now the real idea behind 16.a4 becomes
apparent; MAV‚ÄìMCTS wants to activate its
rook via c3! Rg5 18. Qd2 Rxf5 A knight
paralyzes the entire black position, so Black
desperately sacrifices a rook for some activity.

MAV‚ÄìMCTS earns bonus points for finishing
the game in style! 0 ‚Äì 1

Each game starts with a randomly sampled initial
position from a set of chess960 legal permutations.
Once the game is finished, the agents reverse the
colors and play the game with the same initial
position. In the header of each game we show
the starting order of pieces. A square next to the
diagrams represents a side to play. All games
use Stockfish with 2 seconds of thinking time
per move. We use MAV‚ÄìMCTS to represent the
external search MAV with mean scoring.

Opening Book
In each match-up between two agents, a specific opening is used, and agents swap seats to ensure
each agent plays each opening both as black and as white. The openings are listed in Table 4.
Table 4 | Table of the opening book used for chess. Openings were collected from various TCEC (Top
Chess Engine Championship) seasons. The scores were computed with Stockfish 16 with 1.5B nodes
per position. The scores are all from white‚Äôs perspective (so negative values mean black is better) and
centipawns
were computed via:
